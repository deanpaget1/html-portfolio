<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Dean Paget and I am an aspiring full stack developer. This is my first project 
  that I have done and I have found it reasonably easy.</p>

<p>Currently I work as a senior software engineer coding primarily in C. I work for Leonardo UK
  in Edinburgh and have done so since October 2017. I am trying to challenge myself and learn new 
  things and that is why I have decided to take on full stack development.
</p>

<p>I am currently doing two courses for full stack development. "IBM Full Stack Software Developer 
  Professional Certificate" by IBM on Coursera and "The complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp" by 
  Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy. </p>
