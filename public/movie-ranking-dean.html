        <h1>The Best Movies According to Dean</h1>

        <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
    
        <hr/>

        <h3>Django</h3>
        <p>This is one of my favourite movies. I love Tarantino's style and the twists and turns through the whole movie.</p>

        <h3>Dune Part 2</h3>
        <p>Cinematic Masterpiece. Keeps you gripped in through the whole film and all of the action scenes are amazing.</p>

        <h3>The Dark Knight Rises</h3>
        <p>This was my favourite movie for a long long time. It is a close one between this one and The Dark Knight but this
            takes the lead for me (as contraversial as that is).
